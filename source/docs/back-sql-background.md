# Background

When researching this, you come across a lot of older documents that were written when OpenLDAP was young.  Reading through you get a couple of different flavors of reasons for back-sql.

## Bridge from old to new (LDAP)

Some of the notes indicate that this is a temporary thing to use and that long term use of back-sql is not recommended.

## Building a comprehensive organizational directory

Some examples and work are centered around the idea of using back-sql as part of an overall strategy to glue the disparate systems together.

## Reusing existing data sources

Some of the discussion talks about translating existing data sources to allow reuse of the data without transitioning it to a new system.

## And finally 

Some say you should not use it.  Or maybe it was just the version using Postgres as a back end.
